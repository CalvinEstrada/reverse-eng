## Business Context
 
When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.
 
## Acceptance Criteria
 
```md
GIVEN a Node.js application using Sequelize and Passport
WHEN I follow the walkthrough
THEN I understand the codebase
```
- - -


As I understand, this program is used to build a login database specifically for the use of a login database. 
I might be misunderstanding as well, but to improve this, we would need the steps to install; As well as tweaking the code to suit the user’s specific purpose.
The application itself is to log the user into the targeted app.
The application seems to use the technologies: -Express, Sequalize, Passport, and
MySql.

To use you would need to create a db in mysql called passport_demo, after that open the config.js file 
And insert your data(username, password/etc) open the terminal in the current repo, and run npm i to install all node packages. Then while in the terminal run node server.js and it will successfully connect to http://localhost:8000. Which of course you would need to type into a browser’s search bar.
